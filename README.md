Thresholding Techniques in Image Processing

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates various thresholding techniques in image processing using the OpenCV library.

## Description:

Thresholding is a fundamental image processing technique used to extract specific details and features from an image, allowing for image classification and segmentation.
This script showcases three different thresholding methods: global thresholding, adaptive mean thresholding, and adaptive Gaussian thresholding.
The code is designed to help you understand how to apply these techniques to your own image processing projects.

## Key Features:

Load an image and convert it to grayscale for thresholding.
Apply global thresholding to separate objects from the background using a fixed threshold value.
Demonstrate adaptive thresholding, which computes the threshold value for each pixel based on the local neighborhood.
Compare the results of adaptive thresholding using both the mean and Gaussian methods.

## Usage:

Clone or download the repository.
Run the Python script using OpenCV and numpy.
Observe and analyze the results of different thresholding techniques on the provided image.
